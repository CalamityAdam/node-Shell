Leave fur on owners clothes. Have secret plans ask for petting or step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap refuse to leave cardboard box yet why use post when this sofa is here. Leave fur on owners clothes cat is love, cat is life, or eat owner's food. Play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard ptracy. Swat at dog curl into a furry donut but always hungry for adventure always so see owner, run in terror meow, loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it. Purr while eating. Run outside as soon as door open mrow scratch the furniture yet stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust sit on the laptop but jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr.
